# MEAN Typescript Spike

This project is just an attempt at setting up a project that uses Typescript that gets transpiled, linted, tested, and deployed.  I would also like to build in the SASS chain, along with the js chain.

I will try to note any major observations that I don't think will be as useful buried in code somewhere, but I can't make any promises.  You may just have to read through the source to figure stuff out.
